# Bill Splitting Dissertation

This is the respository for my bill-splitting application that was created for my final year disseration.

## Notes

### Starling Sandbox
The API and OAUTH URL's contained in this project point at Starling's Sandboxed URL's as this application is designed to use machine generated accounts so it doesn't mess with real ones and risk peoples money.

### .env
To run this program you need a '.env' file in the root directory of this application.
The contents should be:
```
STARLING_CLIENT_ID='YOUR_STARLING_CLIENT_ID'
STARLING_CLIENT_SECRET='YOUR_STARLING_CLIENT_SECRET'
```
